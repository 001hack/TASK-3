### 🛠️ Step 1: Install & Set Up OpenVAS (10–15 mins)

**Run these commands in your terminal:**

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install openvas -y
sudo gvm-setup
sudo gvm-check-setup
```

💡 **Note**: First-time setup will download the vulnerability database. It can take up to 10 mins.

Then, start the services:

```bash
sudo gvm-start
```

➡️ Once started, open your browser and go to:

```
https://127.0.0.1:9392 (ITS GET UPDATED )
```

Login using default credentials:

* **Username**: `admin`
* **Password**: (shown in terminal after `gvm-setup`)

### 🖥️ Step 2: Configure a Scan (5–10 mins)

1. Log into the **GVM (OpenVAS)** web UI.
2. Go to **Scans > Tasks** → Click **"New Task"**.
3. Name: `Localhost Vulnerability Scan`
4. **Target**: Click **“Create Target”**:

   * Name: `Localhost`
   * Hosts: `127.0.0.1`
   * Port list: All IANA assigned TCP
   * Save
5. Use default scan config or choose **"Full and fast"**.
6. Click **Create** and **Start** the scan.

---

### ⏳ Step 3: Wait for Scan to Complete (30–45 mins)

Take a break while OpenVAS scans your system. It will analyze:

* Open ports
* OS vulnerabilities
* Web services (if any)
* Outdated software

---

### 📊 Step 4: Review Report (5–10 mins)

Once scan is complete:

* Go to **Scans > Reports**
* Click your report to open
* Sort vulnerabilities by **Severity (High/Critical)**

---

### 📸 Step 5: Take Screenshots (5 mins)

✅ Screenshot examples:

1. Dashboard showing scan completed
2. List of vulnerabilities (sorted by severity)
3. Details of 1–2 critical vulnerabilities
